## Profile Page:

## Important facts before run the project:
- _Before run the project you may execute "npm i" into the project folder to install al node.js files that are not in the project, therefore is one of the reasons that project maybe doesn't run._
- _Last but not less important, don't forget run --> "ionic cordova run browser", if you don't run by this command, the project doesn't show the map and you can't see location, apis features that Gmap have._
